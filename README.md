# DoNotDisturb Resetter

## What it does

This application provides a button that does the following:
- Turn on `Do not disturb` and bluetooth
- Wait 5 minutes
- If there is a WiFi connection, wait until it is disconnected
  - This is checked periodically every 15 minutes
- Wait until the device connects to WiFi again
- Turn off `Do not disturb` and bluetooth

## Why
I want to enable `Do not disturb` and bluetooth while I'm driving (so that my phone doesn't ring, even if the hands-free equipment is disconnected)
and I want to make sure I don't forget to turn it off again.

I wrote this app as a tool just for myself and don't intend it to be used by other people.
However, if parts of it are useful for someone, I provided the Source Code here.
